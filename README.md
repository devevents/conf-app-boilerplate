# Conf App Boilerplate

> Boilerplate of mobile application to help people who want to organize conferences/events and don't have time enough
to create an app with information about the event.

## How it works?

The main technology behind this project is [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), which is a framework for developing hybrid mobile apps. We also use a *bunch of other great technologies* to help us, like the [Jade Template Engine](http://jade-lang.com/), the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor, [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) for logic, [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for tasks automation and many others.

By default, we have the following sections:

- *About* - to describe what's the main goal of your event.
- *Location* - to show where it's going to happen through Google Maps.
- *Speakers* - to list information about speakers.
- *Schedule* - to show the agenda.
- *Photos* - to show a gallery of photos based on the event's hashtag.
- *Sponsors* - to show the brand of your sponsors.
- *Partners* - to show the brand of your partners.
